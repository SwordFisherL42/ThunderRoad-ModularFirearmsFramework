[size=4][center]HitScan/RayCast System[/center][/size]
To configure or toggle the HitScan system for close-range shots, edit the following values in 'Levels/Level_Master.json':
[code]  "useHitscan": true,
  "hitscanMaxDistance": 1.0
[/code]
'useHitscan' can be either true or false, and 'hitscanMaxDistance' is how close (in meters) you must be for the system to activate.

You can also control the HitScan system for individual items by adding these fields to the module of those firearms.
